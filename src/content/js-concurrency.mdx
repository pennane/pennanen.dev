What if instead of just Promise.race, there would be Promise.races :D?

Handling a collection of promises as fast as possible. Once a promise resolves, it is handled ASAP.

Consider:

```ts
export async function* racePromises<A, B>(f: (x: A) => Promise<B>, xs: A[]) {
  const size = xs.length
  const pool = new Map<number, Promise<readonly [number, B]>>()

  for (const [i, x] of xs.entries()) {
    pool.set(
      i,
      f(xs[i]).then((v) => [i, v] as const)
    )
  }

  while (pool.size) {
    const [key, value] = await Promise.race(pool.values())
    pool.delete(key)
    yield value
  }
}
```

```ts
for await (const x of racePromises(heavyAsyncTaskFn, tasks)) {
  // handle the result of heavyAsyncTaskFn as soon as results are available
  // instead of waiting for all promises to resolve with something like await Promise.all(promises)
}
```
