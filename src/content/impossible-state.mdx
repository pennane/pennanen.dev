# Impossible States

With modeling developers can remove the need to add tests for impossible states.

Consider creating some game, where there must always be at least 2 players for the game to be valid.

We could model the players in the game as an array.

```ts
type Game = {
  players: Player[]
}
```

While this is intuitive, it forces the developer to add checks for the player count through out the code base.

```ts
const game: Game = {
  players: [] // We just adhered to the schema, but the schema was lying. Where are our 2 players?
}
```

Instead through the power of modeling, instead of modeling the players as an array, we can force the 2 required players to exist already on type level.

```ts
type Game {
  players: {
    first: Player
    second: Player
    rest: Player[]
  }
}
```

Now its impossible\* to create a game without 2 players.

\*you can of course always do what ever you want, but the types do not allow you to do so by default.
