# Impossible States

Modeling can help eliminate the need for tests that handle impossible states.

Consider a game where at least two players are required for the game to be valid.

We could model the players as an array:

```ts
type Game = {
  players: Player[]
}
```

While this is intuitive, it forces the developer to add checks for the player count throughout the codebase:

```ts
const game: Game = {
  players: [] // The schema is followed, but where are the 2 players?
}
```

Instead, through modeling, we can enforce that two players are always present at the type level, eliminating the need for runtime checks.

```ts
type Game = {
  players: {
    first: Player
    second: Player
    rest: Player[]
  }
}
```

Now, it's impossible\* to create a game without two players.

\*while you can still override the types, they prevent this situation by default.
